# Fabio SVG Logo

This contains the Fabio logo with the
[Sportscenter](https://www.fontzillion.com/fonts/the-sports-fonts/sportscenter)
font which is almost identical to the original Microgramma font.

The `logo-with-sportscenter.svg` contains the full color logo but the reduced
character spacing transformation does not work in Safari and the other browsers
won't render SVGs with glyphs.

The `logo-outline.svg` and `logo-outline-bw.svg` files contain no glyphs and work
in all browsers.

The logo creator generates the logo with the Sportscenter font but the
character spacing transformation is missing. There is also no code to transform
it to outline since I've done that in Adobe Illustrator by hand. Consider it an
exercise.
